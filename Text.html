  <p><strong>Draft Policy on Open Data for the <?= vars['Name'] ?></strong></p>
  <p><strong><?= vars['Number'] ?></strong></p>
  <br>
  <p>WHEREAS, much of the data collected by the <?= vars['Name'] ?> (hereafter, “the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?>”) is stored in ways which impede the ability to aggregate, analyze and synthesize it to better allocate public resources; and</p>
  <p>WHEREAS, access to public information promotes a higher level of civic engagement and allows citizens to provide valuable feedback to government officials regarding local issues; and</p>
  <p>WHEREAS, every citizen has the right to prompt, efficient service from the government; and</p>
  <p>WHEREAS, the thoughtful implementation of an open data program improves provision of services, increases transparency and access to public information, and enhances coordination and efficiencies among departments, partner organizations and citizens; and </p>
  <p>WHEREAS, one goal of an Open Data policy is to proactively provide information currently sought through public records requests, thereby saving the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> time and money; and</p>
  <p>WHEREAS, in commitment to the spirit of Open Government, the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> will consider public information to be open by default and will proactively publish data and data containing information, consistent with relevant public records law; and</p>
  <p>WHEREAS, information technologies, including web-based and other Internet applications and services, are an essential means for Open Government, and good government generally; and</p>
  <p>WHEREAS, by publishing structured standardized data in machine readable formats the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> seeks to encourage the local software community to develop software applications and tools to collect, organize, and share public record data in new and innovative ways; and</p>
  <p>WHEREAS, the protection of privacy, confidentiality and security will be maintained as a paramount priority while also advancing the government’s transparency and accountability through open data.</p>
  <p>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the <?= vars['Who'] ?> of the <?= vars['Name'] ?> that:</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Section 1: Definitions</h3>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>“Data” means statistical, factual, quantitative, or qualitative information that is maintained or created by or on behalf of a <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> agency. This definition is inclusive of software source code developed or maintained by or on behalf of the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?>.</li>
    <li>“Open data” means data that is available online, in an open format, with no legal encumbrances on use or reuse, and is available for all to access and download in full without fees [or a requirement of registration]. “Legal encumbrance” includes federal copyright protections and other, non-statutory legal limitations on how or under what conditions a dataset may be used. This definition is also inclusive of any software source code made available online (“open source software”).</li>
    <li>“Open format” means any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform-independent, machine-readable data format, which permits automated processing of such data and facilitates analysis and search capabilities.</li>
    <li>“Dataset” means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data organized or formatted in a specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form.</li>
    <li>“Protected information” means any dataset or portion thereof to which an agency may deny access pursuant to the [state or city public records statute] or any other law or rule or regulation. </li>
    <li>“Sensitive information” means any data which, if published by the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> online, could raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety or welfare to an extent that is greater than the potential public benefit of publishing that data. </li>
    <li>“Publishable data” means data which is not protected or sensitive and which has been prepared for release to the public.</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <h3>Section 2: Open Data Program</h3>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> commits to develop and implement practices that will allow it to:
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Proactively release all publishable <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> data, making it freely available in appropriately varied and useful open formats, using an open license with no restrictions on use or reuse, and fully accessible to the broadest range of users to use for varying purposes;</li>
        <li>Publish high quality, updated data with documentation (metadata) and permanence to encourage maximum use;</li>
        <li>Provide or support access to free, historical archives of all released <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> data; </li>
        <li>Measure the effectiveness of datasets made available through the Open Data Program by connecting open data efforts to the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?>’s programmatic priorities;</li>
        <li>Minimize limitations on the disclosure of public information while appropriately safeguarding protected and sensitive information; and </li>
        <li>Support innovative uses of the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?>’s publishable data by agencies, the public, and other partners.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

        <li>Develop and implement a process for determining the relative level of risk and public benefit associated with potentially sensitive, non-protected information so as to make a determination about whether and how to publish it; </li>
        <li>Develop and implement a process for prioritizing the release of datasets which takes into account new and existing signals of interest from the public (such as the frequency of public records requests), the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?>'s programmatic priorities, existing opportunities for data use in the public interest, and cost;</li>
        <li>Proactively consult with members of the public, agency staff, journalists, researchers, and other stakeholders to identify the datasets which will have the greatest benefit to <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> residents if published in a high quality manner;</li>

  </ol>
  <br>
  <h3>Section 4: Central Online Location for Published Data</h3>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> will [create and] maintain a publicly available location on the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?>'s website or in another suitable online location where the <?= vars['Short Name'] ?>’s published data will be available for download.</li>
    <li>Published datasets shall be placed into the public domain. Dedicating datasets to the public domain means that there are no restrictions or requirements placed on use of these datasets. </li>
    <li>Each published dataset should be associated with contact information for the appropriate manager of that dataset as well as with a file layout or data dictionary that provides information about field labels and values.</li>
    <li><?= vars['Short Name'] ?> departments will specify a recommended data citation form available for viewing on the central online location for published <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> data to encourage responsible reuse of <?= vars['Short Name'] ?> data.</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <h3>Section 5: Open Data Report and Review</h3>
  <ol type="a">
